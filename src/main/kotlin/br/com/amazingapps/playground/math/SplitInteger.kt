/**
 * In this challenge, you will write a function to divide an integer into a number of even parts,
 * which will be returned in a result array. Summing the integers in this result array will produce the original number.
 *
 * For example, given number = 10 and parts = 2, splitInteger(10, 2) should return an array of integers with
 * length equal to parts: [5, 5].
 *
 * Not all numbers will offer a clean division. In this case, we should split the number
 * as closely as possible to even, with the smaller numbers in the front of the array. For example,
 *
 * splitInteger(11, 3) â†’ [3, 4, 4]
 * There is no reason to test for edge cases; the input to your function will always be valid for this challenge.
